## Redux
Throught this part of the project we'll be familiar with each of the redux key ideas such as:
• All of your application’s data is in a single data structure called the state which is held in the
store
• Your app reads the state from this store
• The state is never mutated directly outside the store
• The views emit actions that describe what happened
• A new state is created by combining the old state and the action by a function called the
reducer

## Project 
# Create react app
npx create-react-app reduc

# Go to new created directory
cd redux

# Install Redux and react-redux
npm install redux react-redux

# Run application
npm start

## Building the main app
1. How to create the reducer inside src folder
2. Create store.js file inside src folder
3. Wrap the app using provider tag provided by redux
4. Create a folder called action inside src folder and add a file called cartAction.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
