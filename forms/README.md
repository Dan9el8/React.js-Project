## Forms
Forms allows  users to directly input and submit data in components ranging from a login screen to a checkout page. Since most React applications are single page applications (SPAs), or web applications that load a single page through which new data is displayed dynamically, you won’t submit the information directly from the form to a server. Instead, you’ll capture the form information on the client-side and send or display it using additional JavaScript code.

React forms present a unique challenge because you can either allow the browser to handle most of the form elements and collect data through React change events, or you can use React to fully control the element by setting and updating the input value directly. The first approach is called an uncontrolled component because React is not setting the value. The second approach is called a controlled component because React is actively updating the input.

## Prerequisites
node.js 10.20.1
npm - 6.14.4

## Installation
How to install node.js(go to the node.js page to download)
npx create-react-app forms

## Running the project
To run this project navigate to the forms directory and run npm start

## Project
git clone https://github.com/Dan9el8/React.js-Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
